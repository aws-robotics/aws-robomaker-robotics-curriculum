How do the robots seen in some of these applications work?
This course will give you the **basics in robotics** to build a robotics system and software, through three learning modules.
1. First, we will delve into the robot's hardware.
2. Second, we study computational problems that robots need to address.
3. Third, we analyze the robot system architecture.

Each module is composed of a number of videos, readings, simple examples, and tests to facilitate the conceptual understanding. This course is not meant to provide full technical details, which would require longer and separate courses; interested students are encouraged to explore the additional resources provided at the end.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Define what a robot is.
- Identify the robot's hardware components.
- Describe the main robotics problems.
- Identify main techniques for each robotics problem.
- Describe robotics control architecture.
