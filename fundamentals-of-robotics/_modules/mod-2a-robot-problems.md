How do we make a physical robot, seen in the previous module, autonomous?

There are some fundamental problems that robotics software need to address:
1. **Models**, i.e., the study of the motion, without forces.
2. **Sensing**, i.e., perceive the surrounding.
3. **Planning**, i.e., decide how to achieve a goal within the environment; a specific problem addressed is *path planning*, i.e., choosing a path of movement.

If the robot also has a manipulator, **manipulation** is another problem that can be studied separately.

We will dive into each of the three problems, providing you the intuition behind so that you have the basics and you can understand robotics software. Each of these topics are currently object of research to enable robust autonomy of robots and you are encouraged to explore them more.

Let's start with [Models]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _modules/mod-2b-models.md %}).
