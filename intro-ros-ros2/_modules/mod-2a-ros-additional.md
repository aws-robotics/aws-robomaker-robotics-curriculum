title: ROS additional components
permalink: /modules/2/additional.html
---

The publish/subscribe framework and the tools that we have seen for debugging are powerful enough to develop interesting robotic behaviors.

There are a few additional components that are useful to know to improve the quality of the robotics software, as well as other tools for testing and debugging. This module will give a brief overview of those components and refer to other tutorials for the interested student who would like to dive deeper.

Let's start with additional ways to "communicate" with ROS nodes in the [next unit]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _modules/mod-2b-other-communication.md %}).
