## Next courses
Now that we have a brief overview of the AWS RoboMaker and a simulator set up for robotics software development in the cloud, the next step for developing and testing robotics systems is to learn the Robot Operating System (ROS). The immediate next course as part of this curriculum is Course 2: ROS fundamentals, which will allow you to become familiar with ROS.
