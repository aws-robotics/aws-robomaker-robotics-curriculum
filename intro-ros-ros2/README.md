# aws_robo_2

This is the repository for the AWS RoboMaker Course 2 - ROS intro and ROS 2.

## Setting up the environment
The content is generated using Jekyll. Take a look at the instructions for setting up the system to generate the site [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).

## Test it locally
Currently, there are two styles:
1. With some style, meant as a standalone website:

        bundle exec jekyll serve serve --trace --config _config.yml,_config-standalone.yml

2. Barebone, meant to be as a way to populate the Canvas course.

        bundle exec jekyll serve serve --trace --config _config.yml,_config-canvas.yml
