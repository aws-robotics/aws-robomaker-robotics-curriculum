## Next courses
Now that we have a brief overview of the main tools for local robotics software development, the next step for developing and testing robotics systems is to learn the Robot Operating System (ROS) and AWS RoboMaker. The immediate next courses as part of this curriculum is Course 1b: Getting started with AWS RoboMaker, which will allow you to become familiar with developing robotics software in the cloud, or directly Course 2: ROS fundamentals, which will allow you to become familiar with ROS.
