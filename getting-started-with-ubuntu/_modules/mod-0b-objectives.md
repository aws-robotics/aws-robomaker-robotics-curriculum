How are the computers on the robots seen in the previous unit's video configured?

This course will give you the **basics** on Linux OS, ROS configuration, and development tools, allowing you to have an environment to build and develop a robotics system and software. Four learning modules are part of this course: 
1. First, we will delve into Linux. 
2. Second, we will configure ROS and understand its structure.
3. Third, we will familiarize with version control systems. 
4. Fourth, we will study how packages are built.

Each module is composed of a number of readings, examples, and tests to facilitate the conceptual understanding. This course is not meant to provide full technical details, which would require longer and separate courses; interested students are encouraged to explore the additional resources provided throughout the course and at the end.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Identify and use Linux utilities.
- Set up a ROS environment to enable the robotic software development.
- Identify and use tools for keeping track of changes on the software.
- Identify and use tools for building software.
