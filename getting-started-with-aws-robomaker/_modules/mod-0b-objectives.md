How are we able to run the simulations and enable robot software development in the cloud, as seen in the previous video?

This course will give you the **basics** on AWS RoboMaker and its connected services, allowing you to have a cloud environment to build and develop a robotics system and software. Three learning modules are part of this course:
1. First, we will delve into AWS RoboMaker.
2. Second, we will understand how AWS RoboMaker connects to all other AWS services.
3. Third, we will configure the development environment.

Each module is composed of a number of readings, examples, and tests to facilitate the conceptual understanding. This course is not meant to provide full technical details, which would require longer and separate courses; interested students are encouraged to explore the additional resources provided throughout the course and at the end.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Define AWS RoboMaker architecture.
- Define AWS connected services.
- Configure the robotics development environment in AWS RoboMaker.
