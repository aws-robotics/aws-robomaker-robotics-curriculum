In this module, the main takeaways are on what problems modeling, sensing, control, and planning are addressing and the main insights of the corresponding methods.

You are very welcome to further expand on the topics. Each of the units can be a full course.
None of the problems covered here are fully solved: robots have been demonstrated to work reasonably well in the lab and structured environments. However, researchers around the world are striving for making the robots robust in challenging scenarios, e.g., in snow or fog. To get started on research, you can take a look at the latest publications at top robotics, computer vision, artificial intelligence, and machine learning conferences and journals, such as ICRA, IROS, AAAI, CVPR.

Despite the thriving research area, there are many robotic systems that can accomplish tasks. Next, we will see how we can organize the architecture of the robot so that the algorithms and software can address the problems indicated here.

Before we go to the next final module, let's assess your understanding through the following assignment.
