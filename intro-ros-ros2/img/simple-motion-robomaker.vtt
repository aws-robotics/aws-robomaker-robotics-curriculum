00:00:00.267 --> 00:00:03.500
First, go to AWS and open RoboMaker.

00:00:09.065 --> 00:00:12.300
Assuming that it was already created from the previous course,

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.300
 open the development environment.

00:00:51.034 --> 00:00:57.700
Once Cloud9 is open, use the terminal to download with git, the package containing the code we have seen in this unit.

00:00:58.034 --> 00:01:00.662
The package should be in the robot workspace.

00:01:32.667 --> 00:01:36.700
The simulation setting can then be changed to point to the new launch file.

00:02:07.534 --> 00:02:12.034
Build and bundle Hello World Robot. This might take a while.

00:02:36.033 --> 00:02:38.700
Once done, launch the simulation.

00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:43.700
This also might take a while to upload the bundle and launch the EC2 instance.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:01.033
When "preparing" appears at the top bar, click on "View Simulation Job Details", which will open a new tab in the web browser.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.700
Once the status becomes "running", the Gazebo client can be run by clicking "connect".

00:03:18.033 --> 00:03:24.700
The code already ran, as can be seen in the Gazebo world, with the robot in a different location from its start pose.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.700
A terminal can be open to run again the node.

00:03:35.367 --> 00:03:37.986
Source the bash file and run again the node.

00:04:04.033 --> 00:04:06.367
The robot will move accordingly.

00:04:33.033 --> 00:04:34.766
Finally the node terminates.
