Thank you for completing this introductory course on ROS1!

Resources are listed below to continue your learning journey.

## Next courses
Now that we have a brief overview of ROS, we know how to write a program to move the robot and reads it sensor data. The next step for developing more complex applications is to learn how to set up a more interesting simulation. The immediate next course as part of this curriculum is Course 3: Realistic simulation with Gazebo, which will allow you to become familiar with Gazebo and create environments where the robotics software can be tested.
