## Next courses
Now that we have a brief overview of the robots components, the robotics problems, and the robotics architecture, the next step for developing and testing robotics systems is to learn the related tools, ROS and AWS RoboMaker. The immediate next courses as part of this curriculum is Course 1a: Getting started with Linux and Course 1b: Getting started with AWS RoboMaker, which will allow you to become familiar with the tools and set up the basic environment for robotics software development in ROS.
