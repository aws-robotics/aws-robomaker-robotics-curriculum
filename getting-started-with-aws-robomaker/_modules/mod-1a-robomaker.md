## What is AWS RoboMaker?
AWS RoboMaker is a cloud service that allows robotic software developers to develop and simulate in the cloud, and deploy applications to robots.

AWS RoboMaker integrates with the Robot Operating System (ROS), a robotics software framework used in research and commercial applications, and a realistic 3D simulator, Gazebo. Such an integration allows the large community of developers working in ROS to easily transition to workflow based on the cloud.

Let's dive into the specifics of its architecture in the [next unit]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _modules/mod-1b-architecture.md %}) to understand what is possible within AWS RoboMaker.
