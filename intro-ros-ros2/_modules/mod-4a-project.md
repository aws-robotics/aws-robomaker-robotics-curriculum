Before concluding this course, let's implement one behavior that can be useful for an application.

A few ideas to work on your project to enable specific behaviors of the robot:

- Follow a wall using the laser sensor. It is suggested to use a feedback controller (e.g., PID).
- Cover a given area. The laser sensor can be used to avoid unexpected obstacles (e.g. think about lawn mowing patterns).
