How can robots be programmed to achieve some tasks?
This course will give you the **basics in ROS** to build robotics software.
1. First, we will delve into the basics of ROS which will allow users to control the robot and read data from robot sensors.
2. Second, we will go through some additional ROS components that are useful to develop and test robotics software.
3. Third, we will look at the similarities and differences between ROS1 and ROS2.

Note that ROS2 is out as a beta version. Many of the concepts presented for ROS1 can reapply to ROS2.

Each module is composed of a number of videos, readings, simple examples, and tests to facilitate the conceptual understanding. This course is not meant to provide full technical details, which would require longer and separate courses; interested students are encouraged to explore the additional resources provided at the end.


By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Define the main components of ROS.
- Write basics robotics software in ROS.
- Create new ROS packages.
- Describe and use other ROS tools.
- Identify similarities and differences between ROS1 and ROS2.
